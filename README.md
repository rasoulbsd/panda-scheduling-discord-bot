# Sedad Bot

Sedad Bot is a scheduling bot for daily check-ins in Discord, similar to Panda, but with additional custom features. This bot helps manage routines and schedules directly within Discord using a set of commands.

## How to Use

### Commands

Use `/panda` to access each command. The main commands follow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) principles to prevent direct database access and handle operations within Discord.

#### Create
- **Routine** (required)
  - Options:
    - Everyday
    - Even Days
    - Odd Days
  - Note: All days include only working days (Monday to Friday).

- **Timezone** (required)
  - Options:
    - UTC
    - Eastern Time (ET)
    - Central Time (CT)
    - Mountain Time (MT)
    - Pacific Time (PT)
    - India Standard Time (IST)
  - Note: All times are stored as UTC times in the database.

- **Time** (required)
  - Range: 00:00 to 23:00

- **Role** (optional)
  - Use `@` to mention specific roles in each routine, such as `@everyone` for all users or `@<user>` or `@<role>`.

- **Context** (optional)
  - Default context:
    ```
    Hey Hey,
